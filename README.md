# Angular-Material

I create this project for a initial setup of <b>Angular Elements</b> (https://angular.io/guide/elements). You will find a container component and 3 custom-components, all this component share the angular core.

The components are using bootstrap that is loaded in the container component, I still working on it because the components separately looks a little bit different.

All custom component can build and loaded as a project to test it.

Running <b>"npm run build:product"</b> it will create a single bundle custom component and copied to the container.

Running <b>"npm run start"</b> it will run a node server to load the dist folder.
